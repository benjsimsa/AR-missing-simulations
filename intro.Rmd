# Introduction

In recent years, the focus in diverse subfields of psychology has been shifting towards complexity, dynamics, and a within-person perspective [@hamaker2012]. Among other things, this shift has been facilitated by the growing availability of smartphones and wearables. These devices allow researchers to use the Experience sampling method (ESM) to collect intensive longitudinal data with a high level of ecological validity [@myin-germeys2018]. Intensive longitudinal data consist of several repeated measurements per day, nested within individual participants [@larson2014experience]. The use of intensive longitudinal data considerably broadens the extent of research questions psychological researchers can investigate and statistical analyses they can conduct. Importantly, the multilevel structure of intensive longitudinal data allows scientists to investigate both within-person dynamic processes and the between-person differences therein [@wright2019]. One of the new research avenues that emerged with the growing popularity of intensive longitudinal data is the study of affect dynamics [for an overview, see @houben2015]. The dynamic affect measures make use of the structure of intensive longitudinal data to take the fluctuating nature of affect/emotions into account.

There are two main approaches to capture affect dynamics: fitting models to the data [such as the first-order multilevel autoregressive (MLAR) model, Koval et al. -@koval2021], and computing within-person descriptive statistics (for instance, aurocorrelation). Both the MLAR(1) model and the within-person autocorrelation estimates target emotional inertia: the degree to which affective states linger [@kuppens2017].

Although some degree of inertia is to be expected in human emotional experiences, a high level of emotional inertia (i.e., a high temporal persistence of emotional states) has been linked to psychological maladjustment [@kuppens2010]. A negative emotion process with a high inertia can get caught in a self-reinforced feedback loop [also called *critical slowing down,* Leemput -@vandeleemput2014]. This causes the process to be partially resistant to both external influences and internal processes, including emotional regulation [@koval2015].

The evidence about the association between emotional inertia and the well-being/psychopathology spectrum has grown steadily over the last two decades. A recent meta-analysis indicated an association between emotional inertia (of both positive and negative emotions) and psychological well-being/psychopathology [@houben2015]. Specifically, higher emotional inertia has been linked to lower well-being and higher ocurrence of depressive symptoms [@brose2015], bipolar disorder [@mneimne2018], and lower response of depression and anxiety symptoms to cognitive-behavioral therapy [@bosley2019]. However, recent evidence suggests that the association of inertia (of both positive and negative affect) and psychopathology/well-being is only limited when the mean affect intensities are taken into account [@dejonckheere2019; @bosley2019; @bos2019; @koval2013].

Despite the popularity of the MLAR(1) models in psychological research, there are several questions about their statistical properties that remain unanswered. One of them is the effect of missing observations on their estimation performance. This is a pressing issue, given that the presence of missing data in intensive longitudinal datasets is more of a rule than an exception: the average compliance in ESM studies is around 79% (*SD* = 13.64%; Wrzus & Nebauer 2022). Furthermore, study compliance (i.e., the rate in which the participants provide answers to ESM beep) is associated with both participant and study design characteristics [@wrzus2022]. Providing financial incentives for participation was found to be associated with increased compliance, and longer ESM questionnaires are associated with lower compliance [@vachon2019; @eisele2020]. Participants with psychotic disorders tend to have lower compliance compared to general population, while the opposite is true for participants with depressive disorders [@rintala2019; @vachon2019]. Higher positive affect, lower negative affect, lower stress, and less alcohol use are linked to higher compliance [@rintala2019; @rintala2020].

While Ji et al. [-@ji2018] show that the presence of data missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR) and not missing at random (MNAR) leads to a considerable bias in point estimates of cross-lagged and autoregressive parameters in multilevel vector autoregressive models when list-wise deletion is used, no similar evidence is available about the MLAR(1) model.

The MCAR missingness pattern assumes that the participants miss responding to beeps randomly, and each beep has the same probability of being missed, regardless on any other factors (e.g., whether the previous beep was missed, or the intensity of the emotion measured by ESM). However, many different missing data scenarios can arise in ESM research. For instance, participants could be more likely to miss a series of beeps when they attend a social event. This will result in a block of consecutive missing datapoints, where neither the starting point nor the endpoint of the missing block depend on the intensity of the emotion. Alternatively, probability of an observation being missing can depend on the value of the emotion process itself. For example, a participant can miss responding to an ESM measure of a positive mood because they are not feeling well enough, or they can be less likely to answer an ESM beep in situations that make them feel very good (e.g., they might skip responding an ESM beep when celebrating). For an illustration on how the different missingness patterns can manifest themselves on the same ESM time-series, see Figure \ref{fig:fig_miss_comparison}.

The goal of the present thesis is to investigate whether compliance (i. e., the inverse of the proportion of missing data for each participant of an ESM study) and the different patterns of missingness described in the previous paragraph (MCAR; data missing in a block; extreme observations missing) have an effect on estimation bias, variability, and statistical power of the multilevel AR(1) model. In the following part, I will describe the multilevel autoregressive model and its assumptions and summarize the already available evidence about its statistical properties from simulation studies.
